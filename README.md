# Legends Perk Tree Rework (PTR)
This is a major overhaul of the Dynamic Perk Tree system in the Legends mod.

## Main Features
- 70+ new perks. 
- Each weapon tree now has 7 perks. This makes many new builds possible.
- Overhaul of the dynamic perk tree creation system with weighted random tree assignment.
  - Other than weapon trees, characters are now assigned trees from 3 further categories: Combat Class (replaces Legends Traits trees), Utility Class and Profession.
  - Many new perks in these trees.
  - Trees are assigned using a weighted random which keeps character backgrounds rather predictable, but you can also find surprises.

## Work in Progress
- Assign weights to all character backgrounds for the dynamic perk tree creation system.
- Edit all enemies to assign them the new perks.
