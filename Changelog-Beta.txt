======================
==== Ver 0.14.2 ======

======================
- Fixed the t3 sword group perk still showing Heightened Reflexes as its name instead of Fluid Weapon.

- Re-added missing Through the Ranks perk in the code as the perk is still used by some AI characters (e.g. Noble Arbalester).

======================
==== Ver 0.14.0 ======
======================
== DEPENDENCIES ==
- Now requires Fencer Perk version 1.5.5. Fencer Perk changes:
  - The Hitchance malus from Sword Thrust and Lunge no longer applies to AI characters.
- Now requires MSU version 0.6.0. MSU Changes:
  - Implemented Weapon Type and Damage Type systems for code backend, which will enable more robust, flexible, and frankly new paradigms of BB weapon and skill modding.
  - Skills can now have modular damage types e.g. x% Blunt, y% Piercing on the same skill.
  - Now shows the Damage Type of a skill in its tooltip.
- Now requires WMS version 1.4.2.
  - Moved the Weapon Type system to MSU.

== MAJOR CHANGES ==
- New Perk Group: Entertainer (Class).
- New Perk Group: Scout (Class). Currently only contains Lookout as t1 perk.
- Moved Second Wind from Fast perk group t5 to Resilient perk group t5.
- New Perk: Dynamic Duo, Fast perk group t5. When there is only one ally within 2 tiles and that ally has no other ally within 2 tiles except you, gain the Dynamic Duo effect. Grants 10 Initiative, 10 Resolve and 5% Melee Defense bonus. If the ally also has this perk, these bonuses are doubled, and whenever that ally gets attacked by an enemy in melee, your next melee attack against that enemy gains +10% chance to hit for one turn. Also grants the Rotation skill even if you do not have that perk. When this effect is active, the first Rotation on your turn has its Fatigue Cost halved and if your ally also this perk, it additionally costs no Action Points.
- New Perk: Always an Entertainer. Entertainer perk group t1. Once per day, when you visit a non-military settlement, gain between 20 and 40 gold. For each level this character is above 1, these values are increased by +2. The values are doubled for medium-sized settlements and tripled for large settlements. If multiple characters with this perk are present, only one of them will entertain in a given city on a given day, and the others will have to entertain in other cities.
- New Perk: Paint a Smile. Entertainer perk group t3. Once per day, increase the Mood of the character with the lowest mood in your roster by 1.
- New Perk: Bulwark, Heavy Armor perk group t5. Gain 2% of your combined current head and body armor durability as Resolve. This bonus is doubled against negative morale checks except mental attacaks.
- Removed Through the Ranks and Piercing Shot from the Crossbow perk group t1 and t6 respectively.
- New Perk: Take Aim, Crossbow t1. Requires Crossbow or Firearm. Unlocks the Take Aim skill which applies to your next ranged attack during this turn. For crossbows, this attack ignores the hitchance penalty from obstacles and the shot cannot go astray. For Handgonnes the attack has its Maximum Range increased by 1 and if used at a shorter range, the area of effect is increased by 1 instead.
- New Perk: Primal Fear, Crossbow t6. Ranged attacks that hit the head have a 25% chance to lower the Morale state of the target by 1 level. Has 100% chance with Crossbows.
- Weapon Master now only provides the mastery bonuses of the perks available in this character's perk tree. Now also requires at least one of the following masteries to be picked before it provides its bonuses: Axe, Cleaver, Dagger, Hammer, Mace, Spear, Sword.
- Double Strike now only works with Melee skills.
- Relax reworked: Now doubles the Fatigue Recovery of the target for their next turn. Cannot be used on the same target two turns in a row. Cannot be used when engaged in Melee.
- Hip Shooter tweaked: Now reduces the Action Point cost of Quick Shot by 1 but each subsequent Quick Shot in this turn builds 10% more Fatigue.
- Entrenched tweaked: Now grants +5 Ranged Skill, Ranged Defense, and Resolve as long as you are adjacent to an ally wielding a melee weapon who is not engaged in melee. The bonuses increase by +1 every turn up to a maximum of +10 as long as you continue to start your turn adjacent to any ally wielding a melee weapon who is not engaged in melee.
- From All Sides tweaked: Now reduces the target's Melee Defense and Ranged Defense by a stacking -3 per hit. Double the effect if it hits the head. Missed attacks reduce the target's defenses by -1 instead.
- Back to Basics reworked: Gain a bonus to key combat attributes depending on how far their Base Values are below a certain thershold. These attributes are increased by a percentage equal to the number of points they are below the threshold. The threshold for Melee Skill and Ranged Skill is 70, and for Melee Defense, Ranged Defense, and Resolve is 40. Also grants +10% Training in camp.
- Removed Man of Steel from Heavy Armor perk group t7. The perk still remains on AI enemies.
- Hybridization tweaked: The Melee Skill bonus is provided at all times, but the Ranged Skill bonus now only works when wielding a Throwing Weapon.

== MINOR CHANGES ==
- In the hitchance tooltip, the following perks now show the quantitative hitchance increase that they provide: Exploit Opening, Pointy End, Ranged Supremacy.
- Made it clear in the tooltip of the Assured Conquest perk that the 10% Resolve bonus is always given and the +10 is provided at positive Morale Checks.
- Perfect Focus stacking damage and fatigue cost malus is now based off the number of attack skills used rather than the number of targets hit or miss. This makes the perk better for AOE skills than before.
- King of all Weapons status effect is now only visible and active during combat, and will not show its effect on the world map.
- The Tactician and Clerk perk groups are now rarer than before.
- Heightened Reflexes (Sword t3) renamed to Fluid Weapon. The icon that was previously used for Versatile Weapon is now given to this perk.
- New icons for Versatile Weapon, Formidable Approach, Heavy Strikes.

== BALANCE ==
- Added PTR relevant perks to the newly added southern slave enemies in Legends.
- Desert Stalkers and Master Archers now gain the full tree of their equipped weapon. However, they never gain Iron Sights and only gain Marksmanship on Legendary difficulty.
- Desert Stalkers no longer have 8 Vision and 1.25x Armor Penetration by default.
- Master Archers now have Berserk without Legendary difficulty.
- Added the Primal Fear perk to Noble Arbalesters, Mummy Archers, Barbarian Reavers, Brigand Leaders, Nomad Leaders, Brigand Warlords, Orc Young, and Ifrits.
- Added the Menacing perk to Frenzied Direwolf, Frenzied Hyena, Large Nachzehrers, Bear, Unholds, Lindwurm, Stollwurm, White Direwolf, Medium Skin Ghoul.
- Added the Bully perk to Frenzied Direwolf, Frenzied Hyena, Unholds, Lindwurm, Stollwurm, White Direwolf, Large Skin Ghoul.
- Stollwurms now gain the same perks that Lindwurms gain in PTR except Survival Instinct.

== FIXES ==
- Fixed the Exploit Opening perk not showing up in the hitchance tooltip if the target had the Exploitable Opening effect, and potentially causing the tooltip to not show up at all.
- Fixed Close Combat Archer not adding entries to the combat log if it applied Stunned or Staggered with blunt throwing weapons.
- Fixed recruits sometimes spawning with the Greatsword perk group from Legends.
- Fixed En Garde giving Riposte at the end of the turn even when Stunned.
- Fixed Trauma Survivor and Assured Conquest not giving Resolve bonus at morale checks.
- Fixed Smashing Shields refunding the Action Point cost of the Split Shield skill instead of refunding 4 Action Points.
- Fixed the Vigilant perk showing up as a Status Effect outside of combat, and missing the icon for the Melee Defense bonus.
- Fixed the Tactician perk group having weights for some other perk groups that weren't intended.
- Fixed Momentum stating in the combat log that it increased damage for Melee attacks even though it didn't.
- Fixed Flail Spinner free attack being possible to hit the body even when the used skill was Lash.

=======================
==== Ver 0.13.10 ======
=======================
- Fixed the Head Smasher perk reducing the target's Steel Brow damage reduction to 25% instead of reducing to 75%.
- Fixed the Exploit Opening perk sometimes causing the battle to freeze when fighting Ifrits.
- Fixed a potential similar error with Pattern Recognition.
- Fixed Flail Spinner being possible to proc on Attacks of Opportunity. Now it should only proc on attacks during the attacker's turn.

== Code Backend ==
- Cull and Flail Spinner now add entries to the game debug log when they proc.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.9 ======
======================
- Temporarily disabled the "Hold the Line" and "Push Forward" skills on Bandit Leaders and other similar high-tier enemies as they were using it too often, hampering their offensive output. Once we find a solution for this, this change will be reverted.
- The Follow Up effect will now be removed when the Morale State changes to Fleeing (it didn't proc when Fleeing anyway, but now the effect is removed as well).
- Fixed the Follow Up effect being removed on moving, as this is no longer intended in the current Follow Up implementation.
- Fixed Phalanx status effect tooltip always showing bonus Melee Skill even when not equipping a Spear and no Melee Skill was being given by the perk.
- Fixed the tooltip of the Survival Instinct status effect not showing up.

== Code backend ==
- Follow Up will now add an entry in the game debug log when it procs.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.8 ======
======================
- Follow Up is now non-lethal i.e. free attacks from Follow Up can no longer kill the target. This change was done to avoid the unexplainable crash that sometimes occurs when Follow Up killed a target.
- Enemies spawning with a Hybrid weapon will now randomly get one Weapon tree based on the categories of their weapon, instead of always getting the alphabetically first one.
- Fixed Rebound and Battle Flow being reversed between the Fast and Agile perk groups. Rebound should now be in Agile and Battle Flow in Fast as intended.
- Fixed a typo in the Utilitarian Status Effect tooltip showing both + and - in the tooltip with the Fatigue in some cases.
- Fixed the perk group names in the tooltips of Hair Splitter, Leap, Tumble, Calm, Holy Man, and Field Repairs perks.

== Code backend ==
- The Fast perk group no longer has a weight to gain the Agile perk group, and the Sturdy perk group no longer has a weight to gain the Large perk group. This is a temporary thing, as it was causing some issues.
- The Greatsword perk group in code now points directly to the Sword perk group, so we don't have to manage it separately.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.7 ======
======================
- Fixed crashes/freeze when used with WMS v1.4.0+.
- Made the tooltip of the Weapon Master perk clearer.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.6 ======
======================
- Now requires WMS v1.4.0 or later.
- Reverted Follow Up back to its original design i.e. now causes an instant free attack on a target who gets hit by your ally. Hopefully this no longer leads to battle freezes when it kills an enemy (it used to happen sometimes, not always). If it happens, please report in #bugs.
- The damage bonuses from versatile weapon are now multiplicative, except the armor ignore bonus which is still additive.
- Clarified tooltip descriptions to no longer have a "+" next to bonuses which are multiplicative. For example, "gain +20% damage" is now described as "damage is increased by 20%" etc.
- Fixed Named Shamshirs doing 0 - 0 damage.
- Fixed the "Easy Target" perk working with all weapons instead of working only with Staves.
- Fixed the Dismantled Armor effect icon not spawning on the target when the effect was reapplied on a target who already had the effect.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.5 ======
======================
- Fixed the Weapon Master perk not giving free swap of one-handed weapons.
- Fixed the fact that Riposte was available on southern swords even without the Exploit Opening perk, and got removed when you picked the perk. Now it should work the other way around, as intended.
- Fixed a case where Discovered Talent would bug out when picking the perk and didn't get activated, and caused all future levelups to be +1 only.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.4 ======
======================
- New Perk "Menacing", Raider perk group t3. Lower the Resolve of adjacent enemies by -5.
- New Perk "Wears it Well", Laborer perk group t6. Fatigue Recovery is increased by 5% of your Maximum Fatigue after gear.
- New perk "Vigilant", Trained perk group t4. At the end of your turn gain Melee Skill and Melee Defense equal to your remaining Action Points up to a maximum of 9. The bonus lasts until the end of your next turn.
- Enemy Swordmasters now have a chance to spawn with Fencing Sword.
- Added the Pattern Recognition perk to all melee Noble soldiers, Brigand Leaders, Brigand Warlords, Nomad Leaders, Hedge Knights, Executioners, Swordmasters, and Blade Dancers.
- Added the Menacing perk to Brigand Veterans, Brigand Leaders, Brigand Warlords, Nomad Leaders, Hedge Knights, Knights, Executioners, Ancient Honor Guards, and all Orcs.
- Added the Bully perk to all melee Brigands and Orc Young.
- Fixed a calculation mistake in Heightened Reflexes which was reducing the Fatigue Cost of skills much more than intended.
- Fixed Kata Step not being usable if you hit other targets in an AOE attack but miss the last target.
- Fixed The Rush of Battle tooltip saying that it is from the Soldier perk group, whereas actually it is from the Trained perk group.
- Improved the tooltip of the Arrow to the Knee skill to now clearly state that it applies to attacks during this turn only.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.3 ======
======================
- Fixed the calculated values for the Initiative and Fatigue Cost Reduction in the Heightened Reflexes Status Effect tooltip being wrong than what was being actually given by the perk.
- Fixed the Dented Armor Status Effect saying -2% AP instead of -2 AP.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.2 ======
======================
- Fixed a freeze in combat due to the Pattern Recognition perk.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.1 ======
======================
- Fixed a freeze in battle when AI switched weapons while having the Offhand Training perk.
- Fixed a bug with Flail Spinner that caused some secondary effects (e.g Stun) from skills like Pound not apply on the free attack.
- Fixed a crash with the Unstoppable perk.

======================
==== Ver 0.13.0 ======
======================
== MAJOR CHANGES ==
- New Perk: "Weapon Master", One-Handed Weapons perk group t7. Grants mastery with all One-Handed Melee weapons and allows swapping one One-Handed weapon for another once per turn for no Action Point cost. Does not stack with Quick Hands.
- New Perk: "Pattern Recognition", Soldier perk group t3. Every attack from or against a target grants a stacking +3 Melee Skill and +3 Melee Defense against that target for the remainder of the combat.
- New Perk: "Bully", Raider perk group t6. Melee Damage is increased by 10% per level of Morale difference between you and your target, as long as your Morale is higher than the target's.
- Reworked Heightened Reflexes (Sword perk group t3). This perk will be renamed in a future build. Now grants 25% of Base Melee Defense as Initiative and percentage Fatigue Cost Reduction on weapon skills, when your armor fatigue penalty is -35. For every point of deviation from -35 the bonuses increase or decrease by 1%. Armor fatigue above -35 increases the Fatigue Cost reduction bonus but reduces the Initiative bonus, and armor fatigue lower than -35 increases the Initiative bonus but reduces the Fatigue Cost reduction bonus. The bonuses can never be negative and never more than 50% of Base Melee Defense.
- Removed Feint from Sword perk group t2.
- Moved Exploit Opening from One-Handed Weapons perk group t5 to Sword perk group t2. In addition to the previous effects, it now adds Riposte to the southern curved swords.
- In addition to its previous effects, Sword Mastery now reduces the threshold to inflict injury by 25% when wielding a southern curved sword.
- Heavy Projectiles reworked: Now requires Sling. Ranged attacks from Slings that hit the head now apply Stunned and that hit the body apply Dazed. If the target is immune to Stun, then hits to the head will apply Dazed and hits to the body will apply Baffled.
- Close Combat Archer: Now also works with Blunt type throwing weapons (e.g. Bolas). With this perk, at 2 tiles, such weapons now have a 100% chance to Stagger upon hit and if the target is already staggered, then stun. The chance is halved at 3 tiles, and is 0 at longer distances.
- The Indomitable effect now prevents you from being Culled.
- The free attack from Flail Spinner now does 50% reduced damage.
- Quick Hands no longer works when swapping one Two-Handed weapon with another Two-Handed weapon.
- Offhand Training, in addition to the previous effects, now also allows you to swap tools in your offhand for free once per turn. Also allows swapping between tool and buckler/parrying dagger. Does not stack with Quick Hands.
- Moved Offhand Training from t7 to t5.
- Unstoppable now only gains stacks from attacks during the attacker's turn. Can still lose stacks by missing attacks when it is not your turn. Hitting targets at 2 tiles now requires two hits to get 1 stack. The two hits do NOT have to be in a single attack. Getting hit now removes half the stacks instead of all of them.
- Perfect Focus: No longer usable when Inspired. Now gives -10% damage and +10% fatigue built for every target hit or miss under the effects of Perfect Focus. Effectively, this means that skills which can be used more times e.g. Quick Shot with Hip Shooter, as well as AOE skills are less overpowered with Perfect Focus, whereas skills which are still usable 2-4 times don't suffer that much.
- Mark Target now costs 7 AP.
- The Professional perk now provides Shield Expert and Weapon Master instead of Duelist and Exploit Opening.
- Buffed the Shield Damage from Throwing Spear to 52. Using it with the Throwing Mastery perk now ignores the target's shield damage reduction from the Shield Mastery perk. Effectively, Throwing Spears will now almost always destroy wooden shields in one hit.
- Overhauled many origin Commander backgrounds to now have a more sensible number of perks in their perk tree.

== MINOR CHANGES ==
- Swapping quivers using Target Practice no longer spends Quick Hands.
- Target Practice now only works when swapping quivers. Not when picking up a quiver or putting a quiver into an empty ammo slot.
- Freedom of Movement: Now only provides 10% of maximum fatigue after gear as bonus. No longer provides the flat or the minimum +5.
- Goblin Spear: Now works as regular glaives, but remains One-Handed as goblin weapons are exceptionally light and agile.
- Spetums and Warforks now also have the Repel skill.
- Made it clear in the tooltip of the Survival Instinct perk that it is a stacking buff.
- Made it clear in the tooltip of the Swift Stabs perk that it only works with daggers equipped in the Mainhand.
- Made it clear in the tooltip of the Cull perk that it ignores Nine Lives on the target.
- Added quantitative information in the tooltip of the Arrow to the Knee perk about the effects of the debuff.
- Discovered Talent: Now can be picked regardless of pending levelups but the increased talents will only apply to levelups obtained from Level 6 onwards. This was the original intent of the perk, and finally it has been implemented that way.

== AI BALANCE ==
- Removed the Kata perk from all orcs, except Orc Berserkers.
- AI will no longer use Arrow to the Knee.

== FIXES ==
- Fixed the game sometimes crashing/freezing when a character with the Exploit Opening perk died.
- Fixed Steel Brow missing from the Sturdy perk group.
- Fixed the tooltip of the Follow Up effect not showing.
- Fixed Flaming Arrows always setting the tile on fire even when the shot missed.
- Fixed a crash/freeze caused by the Formidable Approach perk.
- Fixed a typo in the Follow Up perk tooltip.
- Fixed the Perfect Focus tooltip showing that it belongs to the Vicious perk group whereas it actually belongs to the Trained perk group.
- Fixed Perfect Focus actually showing up in the Calm perk group whereas it is supposed to be in the Trained perk group.
- Fixed The Rush of Battle being a t7 perk, whereas it should have been a t6 perk.
- Fixed the weird text in the beginning of the Duelist perk tooltip.
- Fixed a crash when loading a saved game after picking the Whack a' Smack perk.
- The tooltip of the Cleave skill now mentions the bonus chance to hit if you have the Swordlike perk.

======================
==== Ver 0.12.4 ======
======================
-Edited some tooltips for clarity.
-Fixed Assassin, Event Noble and Trader backgrounds not receiving PTR perks.
-Fixed Close Combat Archer adding too much armor penetration.

======================
==== Ver 0.12.3 ======
======================
- Fixed freezing/crash when entering towns.

======================
==== Ver 0.12.2 ======
======================
- Bloody Harvest now only works with Melee AOE attacks. The perk's tooltip has been updated to reflect this.
- Increased the damage of all glaives by roughly 25%, as they are now Two-Handed weapons and the increased damage is a representation of the Double Grip bonus they had when One-Handed.
- Bandit Leaders, Nomad Leaders, and Bandit Warlords now have a 2 turn cooldown for using Rally the Troops, to encourage them to do more fighting instead of rallying.
- Fixed Swordstaves not being equipped properly.

======================
==== Ver 0.12.1 ======
======================
- Fixed using throwing weapons with the Close Combat Archer perk causing a softlock in the battle.
- Fixed the weapon tooltip of glaive saying that it is One-Handed.
- Fixed the Female Beggar Commander still getting the Promised Potential perk.

======================
==== Ver 0.12.0 ======
======================
== MAJOR CHANGES ==
- Favored Enemy perks have now been added to the weighted random perk tree system. Favored enemy perks will appear on t4 of the perk tree. Most characters will get 1 favored enemy. Rarely some characters will get 2 favored enemies, and very rarely some will get 3.
- Close Combat Archer reworked: Now requires Throwing Weapon. Grants 50% of your Melee Skill as additional chance to hit at 2 tiles. With piercing type throwing weapons, grants 20% of your Ranged Skill as additional armor penetration at 2 tiles. With cutting type throwing weapons, grants 40% of your Ranged Skill as additional armor effectiveness at 2 tiles. The bonuses are halved at 3 tiles, and provide nothing at longer distances.
- Smashing Shields reworked: Abilities targeting shields do +15% damage. If a shield is destroyed using Split Shield, 4 Action Points are immediately regained. Hopefully this makes the perk less obnoxious on enemies and more attractive for players than before.
- Glaives are now 2H weapons categorized as Sword/Spear. They are a hybrid between sword and spear with a bias toward sword. They now have the skills: Glaive Slash, Spearwall, Riposte.
- Swordstaves are now categorized as Spear/Sword. They are a hybrid between spear and sword with a bias towards spear. They now have the skills: Thrust, Spearwall, Split.
- The Legendary Mage Swordstaff is exempt from the above changes.
- Dent Armor: Increased the chance with two-handed hammers to 66% and with one-handed hammers to 33%.
- Discovered Talent can no longer be picked if you have pending level-ups to assign.
- Promised Potential can no longer be picked on the Kingsguard, even if he has the perk available. This is a temporary solution, ideally he shouldn't have the perk available.
- The Beggar Commander no longer has the Promised Potential perk.

== BALANCE ==
- Removed Nimble from Goblin Fighter. The Miniboss (Champion) version still retains the perk.
- Unholds and Lindwurms now use the 66% chance version of Dent Armor.

== FIXES ==
- Fixed the tooltip of the The Rush of Battle perk to mention "Soldier" perk group instead of "Warrior".
- Fixed The Rush of Battle not applying its fatigue cost reduction at the start of a character's turn, until the character used a skill first.
- Fixed En Garde triggering Riposte even when Fleeing.

======================
==== Ver 0.11.6 ======
======================
- Should now be compatible with mods which add other backgrounds e.g. the Magic Mod Trio mod. Although such backgrounds will not be assigned the perk groups in a weighted random way, but rather in the way programmed by the respective mod. Except the Styles trees, which will be assigned by PTR because they contain some essential perks (e.g. duelist, reach advantage etc.) unless these perks are already assigned by the other mod.

======================
==== Ver 0.11.5 ======
======================
- The Vala Commander will now have the Warden perks regardless of if magic is enabled or not.
- The Exhausted effect will now round down the AP after halving. This means that with a Maximum AP of 9, you will start the turn with 4 AP and with a Maximum AP of 10, you will start with 5.
- Fixed Noble Slingers not getting their perks properly.
- Fixed t7 Resilient tree wrongly providing Rebound instead of Last Stand.
- Fixed t7 Fast Tree wrongly providing Rebound instead of Battle Flow.
- Fixed t7 Agile Tree wrongly providing Battle Flow instead of Rebound.
- Fixed Flail Spinner not working with the Chain Flail and Chain Lash skills.

======================
==== Ver 0.11.4 ======
======================
- Fixed a calculation mistake in Last Stand.

======================
==== Ver 0.11.3 ======
======================
- Now compatible with Legends version 15.0.1.15c.
- Made the Talented perk group rarer.
- Discovered Talent: Will always increase the talent stars, but now only provides a levelup of its own IF there are no pending attribute levelups. Effectively, this should discourage storing up previous levelups to retroactively gain the benefit from the increased talent stars from this perk.
- Last Stand: The injury immune effect now starts at 40% remaining HP (up from 33%), but will now only make the character immune to injuries received after this threshold was reached. Injuries received before this threshold will remain active.
- AI should no longer use the Push Forward skill if it is alone.

======================
==== Ver 0.11.2 ======
======================
- Should now be compatible with Legends version 15.0.1.15b.
- Unstoppable now has a cap of 10 stacks.
- The Exploit Opening perk description now properly shows that it requires a One-Handed Melee weapon.
- The Offhand Training perk description now properly shows that it requires a Buckler or Parrying Dagger.
- Fixed several lock-ups during battle caused by the Exploit Opening perk.
- Fixed the Professional perk not being pickable.
- Fixed a lock-up during battle due to the AI Hold the Line behavior bugging out.

======================
==== Ver 0.11.1 ======
======================
- Exploit Opening will now show a plus icon in the chance to hit tooltip if it is applicable on the target.
- Fixed an issue with Exploit Opening which resulted in it not giving the bonus as intended.

======================
==== Ver 0.11.0 ======
======================
== Major Changes ==
- NOTE: You require the updated version of Duelist Defense. Get the latest version from Nexus.
- New Perk: "Exploit Opening" t3 One-Handed Weapons perk group. An enemy who misses a Melee attack against you gains the Exploitable Opening effect which gives you +10% chance to hit against them.
- New Perk: "Offhand Training" t7 One-Handed Weapons perk group. Using a Buckler or Parrying Dagger in the offhand no longer disables the bonus from the Duelist perk.
- New Perk: "Exude Confidence" t5 Soldier perk group. At the start of your turn, increase the Morale state of adjacent allies by 1 as long as your Morale state is higher than theirs.
- New Perk: "Professional" t7 Soldier perk group. Unlocks the Duelist, Exploit Opening, Reach Advantage, and Bloody Harvest perks without having to pick those perks.
- New Perk: "Fruits of Labor" t1 Laborer perk group. Increases Hitpoints, Maximum Fatigue and Initiative by 10% each.
- Soft Metal tweaked: Hammers now get the bonus at 100% armor remaining and other blunt weapons get it at 60% armor remaining.
- Greatly increased the chance of favored enemy perks on all recruits. The type of favored enemy will be mostly random.
- Sanguinary will now spawn an icon when it results in a Morale increase.
- Made some tweaks to the Hold the Line and Push Forward AI.

== Balance ==
- Noble Footmen now have a 20% to have the Linebreaker perk.

== Fixes ==

- Fixed Bone Breaker sometimes proccing even when the conditions weren't fulfilled.

======================
==== Ver 0.10.3 ======
======================
- Added new AI behaviors for the "Hold the Line" and "Push Forward" skills. Still may not be perfect, so please provide feedback on how "intelligent" it feels now.
- Removed the "Protect" AI behavior from Brigand Leaders, Brigand Warlords, Nomad Leaders, and Knights. Now these elite enemies will no longer waste time protecting their ranged units.
- Made some improvements to Arrow to the Knee AI. Now it will be less likely to use the Arrow to the Knee skill against targets of low Melee Skill.
- Hopefully fixed an AI "soft-lock" when using Arrow to the Knee.

======================
==== Ver 0.10.2 ======
======================
- The description of the Dismantle perk now makes it clear that the increased damage the target receives is from all sources.
- Removed the "Nimble" perk from Höllenhund.
- Fixed "Through the Gaps" not showing the increased armor ignore damage in the tooltip of skills (it was working properly, just the tooltip wasn't updated).
- Fixed Nomad slingers not properly getting Sling Mastery.

======================
==== Ver 0.10.1 ======
======================
- Fixed a bug in the Dismantled Effect which caused the target to no longer receive hits.

======================

======================
== Major changes ==

- Moved Strength in Numbers from Militia perk group t7 to t2.
- Reduced the probability of the Spear, Sword, Crossbow, and Staff perk groups overall, to allow for more variety in recruits.

- Increased the chances of recruits with the Apothecary perk group to also have the Calm perk group.

== Balance ==
- Removed the "Vengeance" perk from all remaining enemies who still had that perk. No enemies have this perk now.
- Removed several accuracy and damage perks from a lot of ranged enemies. This will hopefully make them feel less obnoxious.
- Added "Man of Steel" to some enemies.

== Fixes ==
- Removed Marksmanship and Berserk from goblin fighters. These perks were not intended on them.
- Made it clear in the tooltip of Promised Potential that a successful Realized Potential also unlocks new perk groups.

- Removed the base armor penetration bonus that master archers have in vanilla (they had a 25% bonus).

== Perks ==
- Follow Up skill reworked (due to AI crashing issues): Until your next turn, any enemy in your attack range who gets hit by an ally adds 1 charge to this effect. During your next turn, you can use your primary attack skill freely for as many times as you have charges. These free attacks do -50% damage and an additional -10% for each next attack. Once all charges are used up the effect expires and you return back to the usual costs and damage of your attack. If at any point, you move from your position, or are engaged in Melee, this effect ends immediately and all charges are lost.
- Sanguinary tweaked: In addition to the previous effects, attacking bleeding targets improves this character's morale by 1 level and inflicting a fatality immediately sets the Morale to Confident.
- Deep Cuts tweaked: Every second attack against the same target applies an additional stack of bleeding of 5 damage. This damage is increased to 10 if any of these two attacks inflicted an injury.
- Bloodlust tweaked: Every attack against a bleeding target reduces current Fatigue by 5% per stack of bleeding on the target, and increases Fatigue Recovery by +1 per stack of Bleeding on the target.
- Improved the tooltip of the Survival Instinct effect. It now shows the number of stacks in the effect's name.
